                AMD's gaming division is on fire! In a good way!
                <br>
                <br>With the launch of AMD's Navi-based RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT, AMD is signaling a pretty bright future for its graphics division,for desktop and PC gaming. AMD is already well-established in just about all other industries that require high-end graphics: Consoles, Cloud (with Google Stadia), Mobile (via Samsung Partnership) and with Apple, in their laptops, desktop and workstation computers. Even though the 5700 and the 5700XT are not "flagship" graphics cards per se, they are an incredibly important strategically to AMD because they are built on a totally new microarchitecture 
                <br>– RDNA.
                <br>
                <br>As this is a new microarchitecture, there is a lot here beyond just game performance. We've enlisted the help of EposVox to help us with some of the computing, rendering and streaming tests. (Quite frankly, our results didn't make any sense; we were certain we were doing something wrong. Keep reading to learn more.) 
                <br>
                <br>We, of course, put these cards up against the MSI GamingZ RTX 2070 Twin Frozr 7; which is a beastly card and clocks like a champ. A few of our tests also compare against the MSI RTX 2060.
                <br>
                <br>These new cards from AMD are approximately in the same price class, but priced a little better.  Nvidia also fired back – launching the new Super series graphics cards. AMD reacted quickly and tweaked the Navi launch prices a bit, which sweetened the deal even a bit further. 
                <br>
                <br>We are reviewing the AMD launch-version 5700 and 5700 XT, graciously supplied by AMD; thanks AMD!

                The Ryzen 1700 caught my attention in March of 2017. AM4 was a brand new socket in town. $329USD for an 8-core mainstream desktop CPU? It seemed absurd and yet it would be go on to be one of the most compelling CPUs in a decade. At the time a competing 8-core CPU from Intel on the high-end desktop segment cost about $1000 US.
                <br>
                <br>The mainstream desktop performance CPU gauntlet had been thrown down by AMD.  While AMD did not have a clock speed advantage, they offered more cores to offset that disadvantage. Would regular computer users find a use for 8 cores on a mainstream desktop? Would software adapt?
                <br>
                <br>Two years since then Intel has released the overclockable 6-core 8600k and the 5ghz 8-core 9900K which both offer very strong single and multi-core performance.
                <br>
                <br>Even some Intel insiders concede that AMD has become "formidable" in a recently-leaked internal memo; their expectation is that AMD would generally continue to win on multi-thread and high-core count parts.
